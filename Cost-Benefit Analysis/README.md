### Project Details

- [Cost-Benefit Analysis](https://github.com/ephremglu/Management-Information-System/blob/main/Cost-Benefit%20Analysis/Ephrem%20Glushchenko%20Ch01HW.xlsx)

Martin is working to develop a preliminary cost–benefi t analysis for a new client-server system. He has identifi ed a number 
of cost factors and values for the new system, summarized in 
the following tables: 

Development Costs—Personnel: 
 2 Systems Analysts 400 hours/ea @ $50/hour 
 4 Programmer Analysts 250 hours/ea @ $35/hour 
 1 GUI Designer 200 hours/ea @ $40/hour 
 1 Telecommunications Specialist 50 hours/ea @ $50/hour 
 1 System Architect 100 hours/ea @ $50/hour 
 1 Database Specialist 15 hours/ea @ $45/hour 
 1 System Librarian 250 hours/ea @ $15/hour 
 
 Development Costs—Training: 
 4 Oracle training registration $3500/student 
 
 Development Costs—New Hardware and Software: 
 1 Development server $18,700 
 1 Server so# ware (OS, misc.) $1500 
 1 DBMS server so# ware $7500 
 7 DBMS client so# ware $950/client
 
 Annual Operating Costs—Personnel: 
 2 Programmer Analysts 125 hours/ea @ $35/hour 
 1 System Librarian 20 hours/ea @ $15/hour 
 
 Annual Operating Costs—Hardware, Software, and Misc: 
 1 Maintenance agreement for server $995 
 1 Maintenance agreement for server $525
 
 DBMS software: 
 Preprinted forms 15,000/year @ $.22/form 
 
The benefits of the new system are expected to come from 
two sources: increased sales and lower inventory levels. 
Sales are expected to increase by $30,000 in the fi rst year 
of the system’s operation and will grow at a rate of 10% 
each year therea# er. Savings from lower inventory levels 
are expected to be $15,000 per year for each year of the 
project’s life. 
 
Using a format similar to the spreadsheets in this chapter, develop a spreadsheet that summarizes this project’s cash 
fl ow, assuming a 4-year useful life a# er the project is developed. Compute the present value of the cash fl ows, using an 
interest rate of 9%.

What is the NPV for this project? What is the ROI for 
this project? What is the break-even point? Should this project be accepted by the approval committee?
